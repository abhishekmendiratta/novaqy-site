    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services provided by
      [COMPANY LEGAL NAME] ("we", "us", "our"). Effective date: <em>PLACEHOLDER</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By placing an order, creating an account, or otherwise using our services you acknowledge
      that you have read and agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. At checkout you must
      explicitly accept these Terms. We record acceptance (timestamp, IP address, user agent,
      and terms version) for dispute defense.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Purchases, Licensing & Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      Products may include physical goods, software licenses, or digital content. Unless otherwise
      stated in writing, all purchases are final and non‑refundable. Certain products are sourced
      from third‑party distributors (e.g., Redington, Ingram Micro) whose policies prohibit returns
      or refunds; where applicable, purchaser accepts those supplier terms.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Returns / No Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing, all sales are final. For details and narrow
      exceptions (e.g., manufacturer warranty), see our Refund Policy: <a href="/legal/refund">Refund Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payment and Billing</h2>
    <p>
      Payment processing is handled by our payment processors. Billing descriptors, receipts, and
      invoices will include our company name. We keep records of payments, delivery, and license
      activation as evidence for dispute resolution.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Dispute Resolution & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>PLACEHOLDER:</strong> Insert arbitration clause, venue, limitation of liability, and
      disclaimer of warranties consistent with applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may amend these Terms. Material changes will be posted with a new effective date. Continued
      use after notice constitutes acceptance.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      Legal contact: <em>legal@example.com</em> (replace). Business/legal address: <em>PLACEHOLDER</em>.
    </p>

      Developer note: Checkout flow must require explicit acceptance checkbox and server-side
      recording of acceptance (timestamp, IP, user-agent, order id, terms_version). See create-checkout-session
      API for where metadata is recorded. Preserve evidence (invoices from suppliers, activation logs,
      emails) for chargeback defense.
