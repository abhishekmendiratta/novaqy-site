    <section>
      <h2>Summary (Short)</h2>
      <p>
        All sales are final. <strong>Novaqy Cloud LLP</strong> does not accept returns, exchanges, or refunds for purchases of licenses, digital goods, or physical products ordered through our site, except where explicitly required by applicable law or where a manufacturer or supplier warranty applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppliers for certain products may include third parties whose policies restrict returns or refunds. By completing a purchase you acknowledge and accept that supplier policies may restrict returns and refunds.

    <section>
      <h2>No Returns / No Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise required by applicable law, all purchases are final and non‑refundable. No partial refunds will be issued unless explicitly authorized in writing by an officer of Novaqy Cloud LLP. This policy applies to license purchases from suppliers whose terms prohibit returns and refunds.

      <h2>Chargeback & Dispute Defense (Developer / Admin Guidance)</h2>
      <p>
        We maintain detailed records to defend against chargebacks and payment disputes. When a customer completes checkout they have explicitly accepted our Terms and Privacy Policy, and the system records the acceptance evidence (timestamp, IP, user-agent, and terms version).
      </p>

          <li>Acceptance metadata is recorded in Stripe Checkout session metadata and persisted to our orders table. See <code>/api/create-checkout-session</code> and <code>/api/finalize-order</code>.</li>
          <li>Attach supplier invoice(s), license activation logs, delivery confirmations, and email threads to the corresponding order record to strengthen dispute evidence.</li>

          <li>Ensure Stripe statement descriptor is consistent and recognizable to reduce consumer confusion (set <code>STRIPE_STATEMENT_DESCRIPTOR</code>).</li>
