# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project initialization and tooling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Taskmaster, configure models, create .taskmaster structure, and add initial developer docs.
# Details:

Completed the initial Taskmaster onboarding work using the provided `prd.txt` and `MVP-Context.md` as authoritative references. The repository already contained a `.taskmaster/config.json`; additional onboarding artifacts were added to make the project Taskmaster-ready without committing secrets.

- Created `.taskmaster/docs/overview.md` with onboarding instructions and recommended commands.
- Created `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt` as a compact PRD example for `task-master parse-prd` testing.

Notes:
- No API keys or secrets were added. Populate `.vscode/mcp.json` or local `.env` for model provider keys when running AI-backed Taskmaster commands.

# Test Strategy:

- Confirm file presence:
  - `.taskmaster/config.json` (already present)
  - `.taskmaster/docs/overview.md`
  - `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt`
- Run Taskmaster CLI locally (once installed) to validate basic commands (example):
  - `npx task-master-ai --help`
  - `npx task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt --tag master --dry-run` (requires models configured)
- Ensure no secrets were committed: `git status --porcelain` should show no new .env or secret files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and initialize Taskmaster in the project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the Taskmaster package (globally or locally) and run the initialization command to set up the base project structure.
### Details:
Run locally as needed:
```
npm install -g task-master-ai
task-master init
```
Or use npx:
```
npm install --save-dev task-master-ai
npx task-master init
```

## 2. Configure language models for Taskmaster [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up and configure the preferred AI language models for Taskmaster, including primary and fallback options.
### Details:
Populate models via the CLI:
```
task-master models --setup
```
Or edit `.taskmaster/config.json` locally. Recommended pattern: local Ollama or OpenRouter model for main/research roles, and a fallback model (Perplexity/Claude). Do not add API keys to the repository.

## 3. Create and organize the .taskmaster project structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Ensure the .taskmaster directory contains required subfolders and templates, such as docs, templates, and configuration files.
### Details:
Minimal structure and templates were added to `.taskmaster/` to make the repo Taskmaster-ready.

## 4. Configure initial Taskmaster rules and settings [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add or customize Taskmaster rules (e.g., coding standards, editor integration) to align with project needs.
### Details:
Guidance for rule selection and `task-master rules` usage is documented in `.taskmaster/docs/overview.md`. No automatic rule changes were applied.

## 5. Draft and add initial developer documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create initial developer documentation covering project setup, Taskmaster usage, and contribution guidelines.
### Details:
See `.taskmaster/docs/overview.md` for onboarding steps, required environment variables (from `prd.txt` and `MVP-Context.md`), and recommended workflows.
