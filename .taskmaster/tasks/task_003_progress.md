# Task 003 — Progress & Next Steps (updated)

Latest status:
- Axe-core scan: completed locally against the built site — no violations. Report: `/home/abhishekmendiratta/Novaqy_MVP/a11y-axe-report.json`.
- Lighthouse run produced a report file (`web/reports/lh-report.json` found) with an accessibility score of 1.0 (100%).
- LHCI autorun completed successfully, uploading the report to temporary public storage.
- Jenkins accessibility stage snippet created at `.jenkins/accessibility-stage.groovy` and updated to run `npm run prepare:assets`.
- npm scripts for a11y added to `web/package.json` (`test:axe-playwright`, `test:lh`, `test:lhci`, `test:a11y`). The `test:lhci` script was updated to include `LHCI_BUILD_CONTEXT__CURRENT_HASH=manual` to prevent git hash errors during upload.

Next actions (priority):
1. Manual senior checklist validation (200% zoom, keyboard navigation, screen reader checks).
2. If LHCI / manual checks surface issues, triage and fix, then re-run automated checks.

Quick commands
```bash
# View axe report
cat /home/abhishekmendiratta/Novaqy_MVP/a11y-axe-report.json | jq .

# Start preview (separate terminal)
cd web && npm run preview -- --port 4322

# Run Lighthouse (after preview is up)
cd web && npx lighthouse http://localhost:4322 --only-categories=accessibility --output=json --output-path=./reports/lh-report.json

# Run axe-playwright via npm script
cd web && node ./scripts/run-axe-playwright.js http://localhost:4322

# Run LHCI (after adding config)
cd web && npm run test:lhci
```
