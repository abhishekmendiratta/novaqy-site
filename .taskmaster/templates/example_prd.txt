Project: Example PRD for Taskmaster

Summary:
Create a simple homepage and a plans page with 4 one-time plans. Ensure static generation and good accessibility for seniors.

Requirements:
- Static pages: /, /plans, /about, /contact
- Four plans: mobile, individual, family, family_plus
- Large CTAs and senior-friendly typography (base 18px)
- Stripe Checkout integration for purchases (redirects to /success or /cancel)

Success criteria:
- Pages pre-built at build time
- Lighthouse performance >= 95
- Accessibility: axe-core zero violations

# Overview  
[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.]

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- What it does
- Why it's important
- How it works at a high level]

# User Experience  
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- User personas
- Key user flows
- UI/UX considerations]
</context>
<PRD>
# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

# Risks and Mitigations  
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

# Appendix  
[Include any additional information:
- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
